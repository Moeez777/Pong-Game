Before you start playing Pong, make sure you have Python and the Turtle graphics library installed on your system. To play the game, follow these steps:

Clone or download the repository to your local machine.

Open your terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where you saved the code.

Gameplay
Use the up and down arrow keys to control the right paddle.
Use the 'W' and 'S' keys to control the left paddle.
The game starts as soon as you run the main.py file.
Score points by preventing the ball from passing your paddle.

Files
main.py
This is the main script that runs the Pong game. It sets up the game screen, paddles, ball, and handles game logic, including scoring and collisions.

The first player to reach a predefined score limit wins.
Enjoy the Game!
Feel free to modify the game, add new features, or improve upon it as you see fit. Have fun playing and learning from this project!
